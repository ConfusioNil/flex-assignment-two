# flex-assignment-two

This another project to get a better understanding of flex and how and to manpulate it better.

In my previous flex assignment it took me a few hours to figure out how everything worked. Now with this website I aimed to design UI for the website myself and then implement it. 
Which pretty much look an hour, a vast improvement of my design skills and one that I hope i'll carry with me for awhile.
